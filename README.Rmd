## Introduction

Estimating phylogenetic trees is crucial in many areas of evolutionary biology.


```{r cars} 
aln_path <- "bears_fasta.fa"
bears <- read_alignment(aln_path)
tree <- read.tree("data/starting_tree.tre")

sample_df <- generate_sliding(data_set = bears, start_char = 45, stop_char = 62, steps = 4)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot_vector <- generate_tree_vec(bears, sample_df, aln_path, tree)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
